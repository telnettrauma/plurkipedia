Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Oh, did we mention, we’re sorry?

For those that missed it, our scheduled 1 hour maintenance window earlier this morning took quite a bit longer than we had anticipated. We admit, it was poor prognostication on our part. And that was bad. But in a way, it was also very good. Why? Plurk underwent a deep cleansing today, added some new features and is now speedier than ever. Here’s what the update means to you:

- The goal of this update was to prepare ourselves for rapid feature deployments without the need to take the site offline to complete them. Like us, we notice Plurkers are very passionate people, so we want to keep you as happy as possible. This update will hopefully allows us to make updates to the site on the fly without the requirement for periods of prolonged downtime.
- We introduced a new tabbed filtering view for the timeline which allows you to better filter out your plurks into: all plurks, just your plurks, and now, just private plurks. The introduction of viewing your ‘private plurks’ was a highly requested feature and now it’s easy to view those more critical plurks from cliques or other friends. (Think of it as an inbox for more intimate communication)
- The update allows us to slice and dice your timeline in more interesting ways and offer you additional filtering options down the road. (So, for example, you will be able to view just those plurks you’ve participated in, just those plurks sent to cliques or just those plurks you’ve favourited….all these features coming soon!)
- We purged a lot of the gunk in Plurk’s arteries and gave it some Aspirin and now it should be livelier and more responsive than ever. We have a few more changes coming by the end of next week that should improve responsiveness even further.

On the downside, we understand that a lot of people lost a lot of karma through no fault of their own due to our longer than projected downtime ![:-()](/media/archive/blog/emoji/icon_sad.gif) Plurk went on a bit of an extended holiday, but we know you were still knocking on our door to come visit. Therefore, we think it only fair that we compensate all Plurkers a few extra karma points for our mistakes. Have a look at your karma and you’ll notice we’ve raised it +1 point across the board!

Once again, sorry.
