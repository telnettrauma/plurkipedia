We have heard your complaints about our old widget (too fat, too orange, not plurktacular enough) and we have improved it vastly, hopefully to the point of plurfection. The new widget features include the following:

- You pick the colors that you like and that best match your website
- You decide the width and height of the widget
- Every user that signs up via your widget will increase your karma and become your fan on Plurk

The new widget can look like this, but it’s really up to you to decide how you want to spice it up:

Grab the widget from the [Profile edit](http://www.plurk.com/Settings/show?page=widget) tab and start getting your blog readers on Plurk!

We have another widget right around the corner for all you Facebook, Myspace, Orkut, Bebo and other social networking junkies.
