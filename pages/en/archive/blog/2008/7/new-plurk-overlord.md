Mark it down on your calendar folks. Today, July 6th, 2008, is a special day in Plurkistan. Yes, today we bear witness to the first Plurker ever to reach the rarefied air that is Plurk Nirvana! Congratulations are in order forÂ [WendyKnits](http://www.plurk.com/user/wendyknits), who surpassed Karma of 81 and thus becomes the first member on Plurk to reach Nirvana. To paraphrase the humble words of Neil Armstrong, this is one small step for Plurk, one giant leap for Plurkkind! Congrats again, Wendy.
