As I alluded to in my previous entry, Plurk endeavours to take a wholly global approach in how we let our users communicate with each other.  To this end, one of the fanciful features I’m sure most of you’ll discover, especially if English isnt your mother tongue, is our support for colour coded verbs/qualifiers in a host of other languages.  Click the “Plurk privacy and options” tab underneath the Plurk box on your timeline and you’ll see the current list of supported languages for qualifiers/verbs which include German, Russian, French, Chinese, Danish and Russian.  In an effort to broaden our appeal to a wider audience, we’re looking to you to help us translate the base stock of English qualifiers/verbs into additional languages.  Here are the ones we’d love to add:

- Spanish
- Portuguese
- Italian
- Arabic
- Malay
- Tagalog/Filipino
- Japanese
- Polish
- Korean

If you think you might be able to help out, please do get [in touch with us](http://www.plurk.com/contact)!  Of course, if there are other unsupported languages you’d like to see on Plurk, also give us a shout and we’ll add them to the queue.
