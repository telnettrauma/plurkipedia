One of the most requested feature from plurkers is the ability to ‘mute’ certain plurks so that they won’t receive any future ‘new response’ notifications from it.

Well, be careful of what you wish for.

This will be one of the many more noise-reducing features we will be introducing in near future.

Keep the feedbacks coming and thanks for helping us make plurk-land a better place to hang out.

_and yes, the site was down just a while ago while we were pushing out this feature. Sorry about that._
