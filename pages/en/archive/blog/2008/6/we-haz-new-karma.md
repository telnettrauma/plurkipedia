We have now implemented a new (and shiny) algorithm that should be more fair. The new algorithm will give karma points for (generally) positive actions and take karma points for (generally) negative actions.

## Examples of positive actions:

- Plurking each day (quality plurking that is)
- Get responses on ones own plurks from other plurkers
- Getting extra fans
- …

## Examples of negative actions:

- Karma will be lowered if a user requests friendship and gets rejected
- Getting unfollowed by friends will lower a user’s karma
- Spamming other users with too many plurks
- …

## Small extra features

Other than these changes, we have made it possible to more easily follow your karma growth. If you hover over karma, you can see how much you have gained since the last karma update:

Also, when you expand the info box of a user, you’ll now be able to see this user’s karma:

Enjoy the karma updates. We’ve got a lot of goodies in store for the coming week! Stay tuned and keep on plurkin.
