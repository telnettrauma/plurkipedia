We at Plurk take user privacy very seriously and we want to make it easy for users to protect themselves against a few rotten apples. You’ll find that 99.9% of the people you run into Plurkistan are just fab, but every now and then, you’ll run into someone unsavory or spammy.

Well good news, now you can easily block another user using our drop down info box:

A blocked user won’t be able to see your profile, follow you, respond to your plurks or befriend you. Out of sight, out of mind, as they say. More granular goodness to come.
