Now we <span class="wants">want</span> YOU to help us in our first ever **Plurktacular Design Contest**. The contest is a way for you to share your love of Plurk with the rest of our humble community in a creative way. Let your passion for Plurk loose in Photoshop, Flash, Illustrator, on your art easel, with a knitting needle, in your photos or in a video and submit the entry to us on our Plurktacular Design Off page.

Here are some ideas you might want to incorporate in your entries:

- Funny t-shirt ideas
- Stickers, icons, badges, buttons
- New emoticons just for Plurkers
- Funny media. Pictures that incorporate Plurk in someway, videos uploaded to Youtube etc
- Creative videos on why you love Plurk, how you use Plurk, or explaining what the site is all about to new people
- Anything else. Jewelry incorporating the Plurk creatures, sock puppets, Plurk themed food ![:)](/media/archive/blog/emoji/icon_smile.gif)

We’ll feature the **20 best entries** once our first contest ends on September 25th and award our winners each with a **$50 Amazon.com Gift Certificate**.

And if you don’t win this time around, just wait for our next contest! We have some great contests planned for our users in the coming months. We’re also going to thinking of ways to give back to all the users who’ve already helped us out in some shape or form (by starting Plurk related sites, helping us with [PCTP](http://pctp.plurk.com/), or just helping new users with the service) . Stay tuned.

## **Here’s how to get involved:**

1. Download [Plurk’s Art Pack](http://plurk.com/s/art_pack.zip) and the submission rules of the contest
2. Submit an entry on our [submission page](http://www.plurk.com/DesignOff/add) before September 25th, 2008! (You may submit something already out in the wild that you’ve created before which incorporates Plurk!)
3. Sit back and wait a week and we’ll announce the first round of winners on October 1st!

Have fun and good luck to everyone involved. We can’t wait to see and share some of the entries with all our fellow Plurkers!
